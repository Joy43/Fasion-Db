# Welcome to FashionDB Mobile App üëóüì±

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## üöÄ Get Started

1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```
````

2. Set up environment variables  
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with these values:

   ```
   EXPO_PUBLIC_BASE_API=
   NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_CLIENT_KEY=6Le-QeUqAAAAAKKUgbeo1PMIGTI1djE32bediPrY
   NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SERVER_KEY=6Le-QeUqAAAAAA2QOCIBzk4Hrm2B97OgI2f9OyFO
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dluuillmt
   CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=upload_car
   CLOUDINARY_API=
   ```

3. Start the app
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

## üì± Running the App

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in:

- [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) (limited sandbox)

## üõ† Development

Start developing by editing files in the **app** directory. This project uses:

- [File-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction)
- React Native
- TypeScript (if configured)

## üîÑ Reset Project

When you need a fresh start:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This moves starter code to **app-example** and creates a blank **app** directory.

The app uses these services:

- **Backend API**: `https://fasion-db-server.vercel.app/api/v1`
